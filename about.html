        <div class="description">
          <p class="about-desciption">We are fellows of the Inaugural Criminal Justice and Mass Incarceration Track of the 2023 Georgetown Day School Policy Institute. During our four weeks at the Institute, we embarked on an in depth dive into the American Carceral System and the issues within it. Our track meet with police officers, formerly incarcerated individuals, defence attorneys, prosecutors, think tanks, activists, district attorneys, judges, policy makers, and elected officials. Quizcarceration is our brain child, a way to present and explain the many different perspectives we heard and we hope it will inform you or at the least spark new thinking about criminal justice in America. </p>
